## Chapter 5: Class D and Class D

### Part 9

(Kei's POV)

At that day two girls from class 2-D was hanging out together.

It was me Kei Karuizawa and my friend Maya Sato. The two of us have spent time together pretty often several months ago, but that time has been reduced significantly. It's not like we had a fight or something similar. Perhaps on subconscious level I felt guilty for her.

"Sorry, Karuizawa-san, that I called you so suddenly."

"No, It's all right. I wanted to talk with you as well, Sato-san. We didn't go anywhere like that for a long time, did we?"

"Yes. Almost from beginnig of the school, we used to hang out together."

Walking a little ahead of Sato I looked back and asked her.

"So that are we going to do? It's too early to have a lunch, uh..."

It was now about 11 in the morning.

Sato-san called me and suggested walking around the Keyaki shopping mall.

But when we were just about to enter the mall, she started pani—Åking.

"Hey, well..."

"Hm? What's happened?"

"That... Can we go there?"

When she said that she pointed to school building which obviously have nothing in common with the mall.

"School? Do you have something to do there? Today is day off and we are not in school uniform, are we?"

"It doesn't have to be a school. I just want to go where there are not other people around."

I frowned because I didn't understand that she meant.

No, of course, I had a feeling about that. However I put it into the farthest corner of my mind, considering that now this is irrelevant.

It will be better if I keep talking like I don't notice anything.

"Sato-san, did something happen to you? Do you feel well?"

"I just wanted to talk with you..."

I had a very bad feeling but I didn't have any choice beside to follow after her.

I agreed and we went to school building.

We found the place where were not people so we don't have to worry if somebody hears us.

"Come on, lay out what happened. We are friend, aren't we?"

I didn't try to smooth things over when I asked that.

Even if I understand it I still have to ask like this.

First and foremost Kei Karuizawa is key figure in class 2-D that unifies all girls. I am self-centred person who doesn't think about feelings of others.

If I stopped then my image would be ruined.

At least Sato-san should think like that.

And because of that she will be not angry at me.'

Kei Karuizawa will be forgiven for noticing nothing and not even caring about it.

To some degree I actually relied on my egocentrism.

Perhaps, if I keep act like that then she won't go ahead afraid of possible bad outcome.

However... Sato-san decided to continue.

"Karuizawa-san... Tell me why did you break up with Hirata-kun?"

"Um. I did tell reason, didn't I?"

Even if it's indirectly but it's related to Kiyotaka, so my heart rate increased dramatically.

Nevertheless, thanks to my experience I could hide my emotions away.

"Yes, you definitely told, but... You know, your versiong was very strange."

"And? I thought that telling you all will be just waste of time. Why did you ask? Aiming to became his new girlfriend."

While doesn't mention Kiyotaka
