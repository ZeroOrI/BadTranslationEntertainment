## Chapter 5: Class D and Class D

### Part 9

(Kei's POV)

At that day two girls from class 2-D was hanging out together.

It was me Kei Karuizawa and my friend Maya Sato. The two of us have spent time together pretty often several months ago, but that time has been reduced significantly. It's not like we had a fight or something similar. Perhaps on subconscious level I felt guilty for her.

"Sorry, Karuizawa-san, that I called you so suddenly."

"No, It's all right. I wanted to talk with you as well, Sato-san. We didn't go anywhere like that for a long time, did we?"

"Yes. Almost from beginnig of the school, we use to hang out together."

Walking a little ahead of Sato I looked back to look at her and asked.

"So that are we going to do? It's too early to have a lunch, uh..."

It was now about 11 in the morning.

Sato-san called me and suggested walking around the Keyaki shopping mall.

But when we were just about to enter the mall, she started paniсking.

"Hey, well..."

"Hm? What's happened?"

"That... Can we go there?"

When she said that she pointed to school building which obviously have nothing in common with the mall.

"School? Do you have something to do there? Today is day off and we are not in school uniform, are we?"

"It doesn't have to be a school. I just want to go where there are not other people around."

I frowned because I didn't understand that she meant.

No, of course, I had a feeling about that. However I put it into the farthest corner of my mind, considering that now this is irrelevant.

It will be better if I keep talking like I don't notice anything.

"Sato-san, did something happen to you? Do you feel well?"

"I just wanted to talk with you..."

I had a very bad feeling but I didn't have any choice beside to follow after her.

I agreed and we went to school building.

We found the place where were not people so we don't have to worry if somebody hears us.

"Come on, lay out what happened. We are friend, aren't we?"

I didn't try to smooth things over when I asked that.

Even if I understand it I still have to ask like this.

First and foremost Kei Karuizawa is key figure in class 2-D that unifies all girls. I am self-centred person who doesn't think about feelings of others.

If I stopped then my image would be ruined.

At least Sato-san should think like that.

And because of that she will be not angry at me.'

Kei Karuizawa will be forgiven for noticing nothing and not even caring about it.

To some degree I actually relied on my egocentrism.

Perhaps, if I keep act like that then she won't go ahead afraid of possible bad outcome.

However... Sato-san decided to continue.

"Karuizawa-san... Tell me why did you break up with Hirata-kun?"

"Um. I did tell reason, didn't I?"

Even if it's indirectly but it's related to Kiyotaka, so my heart rate increased dramatically.

Nevertheless, thanks to my experience I could hide my emotions away.

"Yes, you definitely told, but... You know, your version was very strange."

"And? I thought that telling you all will be just waste of time. Why did you ask? Planning to became his new girlfriend?"

So far she din't mention Kiyotaka. My question was aimed to confirm my concerns. Sato-san didn't answer my question. I could not see her face.

"Karuizawa-san broke up with Hirata-kun for another 'goal', am I right?"

I got that... As expected from Sato-san, she noticed. In the end she discovered that I fall in love with Kiyotaka and our relationship has changed.

"What? I don't understand thar you mean."

Until this moment I forced myself to act as usual.

While I understanding that our relationship sooner or later will be revealed I still didn't have other choice beside to keep evading the questions. 

I always can deny no matter that she will ask.

No... I thought that I could.

"Karuizawa-san... are you dating Ayanokouji-kun?"

"Huh!?..."

I didn't expect that. That sudden shoot was made before I could prepare for it.

If I hesitated for a little with any other then there wouldn't be any problem but in Sato's case this error was fatal.

As expected she was able to see through me.

If she asked about my feelings towards him, then I would still able to hide my emotions, perhaps.

But that she meant it was something more strong.

"Am I right?"

"Wait,no..no, wait! Why did you decide that?"

Of course, I begane to deny that. I have to do that. Now I can't just confess.

"I am not..."

Before I could say that I wanted our eyes has met.

She was angry but at the same time I can feel that she are going to cry.

Her reaction was understandable, Sato-san trusted me and we even discussed her affection towards to Kiyotaka.

At that time I helped her while hidding my own feelings. If I were in her place, when after my best friend started dating with guy, that I like, then I would aslo be angry and slap her...

I don't need anymore to confirm her words, Sato-san has already known about us.

"At that day when I asked to help for date with Ayanokouji-kun. Tell me, have you alredy liked hime?"

"Wait, please, I..."

While Sato-san was pressing me with questions I was able only to endure.

"I shared my suspicious with Matsushita-san and others. I was defenitly interested in knowing if that was possible that Karuizawa-san would break up with Hirata-kun from her love for Ayanokouji-kun. I was really quite sure about this." 

Kiyotaka told me that Matsushita started to be suspicious about our relationships.

I don't have any other way to avoid this situation.

"Tell me the truth. Or else... Or else I can't be your friend anymore."

Her words was overflown with emotions.

Until the she tried to stay friend with me no matter what.

"That's..."

I can't hide it looking at Sato-san's eyes anymore.

From where should I begin?

There no more reason to hide it anyway.

To apologize I have to confess about everything.

"I and... Ayano... Yes, it is as you said it before, I defenitly dating with Kiyotaka."

Sato-san obviously was shocked after hearing my words.

Even if she confessed and was regected she still loves him.

"You are calling him just by first name, are you?"

Her eyes were cold but I have to face her.

"We started dating at the end of spring holidays. But even before that I had some feeling for him."

"More than anything right nome I want to hear when you fall in love?"

"I don't know... But when you discussed you feeling I have already begun to treat him as person of the opposite sex."

"I got that..."

It seems she did't like my answer.

"You are angry at me, aren't you?"

Now I can't see her eyes however earlier she was starring at me.

"You think that I will be happy after hearing that, don't you? You knew exactly how I felt towards Ayanokouji-kun, but either way you got closer to him behind my back!"

I don't have any way to deny that.

"But Ayanokouji-kun rejected my feelings himself... I don't have right to be angry at you, but..."

A gentle spring breeze blew right in front of me.

*SLAP*

After hearing this sonorous sound I realised that she hitted me.

"Do you agree ...... that we are even with this, Karuizawa-san?"

I defenitly didn't expect that she could hit me.

However, I'm afraid what I've done is not something Sato-san's heart can so easily forgive.

"One isn't enough, is it?"

I turned my head and offered right cheek.

I am sure, that Sato-san has been through more pain than I'm feeling right now.

" No, that is ... I don't have the courage for that ... Actually, sorry that I slapped you."

"Don't mind it. I should also apologize. Because I ended up liking, the same person as you..."

"That can't be helped. After all Ayanokouji-kun is really cool, much more than Hirata-kun."

I couldn't help myself and hugged Sato-san.

"Uh...wait, Karuizawa-san, what are doing?"

"...I'm really sorry!"

"I-I already said its alright..."

Not only was there a lot of regret in my heart, but also a lot of joy, so I started to express those feelings.

Loving the same person is very painful. However, it means that we both understand why we fell in love with him.

In this case, it is too early to say who won or lost.

I'm sure there'll be people in the future who can also find something in Kiyotaka.

I have to fight to not lose him.

And if I don’t watch out for my friend, she might even be my rival.

"Want to go drink tea?"

In return, Sato-san just quietly nodded.
